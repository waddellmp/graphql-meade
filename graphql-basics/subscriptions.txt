Subscriptions

GraphQL supports subscription based communication through web sockets.

Web sockets allow a client app to maintain a stable connection to a server.

Subscription allows the server to transmit data to a client in real-time.


Example

A user writes a comment on a post. When the user posts a comment via http,
the server can update all other clients with the new comment using a subscription.

Process to create a subscription.

Step 1

Go to the type definition file schema.graphql. And Add

type Subscription {
    count: Int!
}


Step 2

Go to index.js and import PubSub from graphql-yoga. Also import the new resolver Subscription (explained in step 3)
(Each grapql framework has its own subscription process.)

import { GraphQLServer, PubSub } from 'graphql-yoga';
import {... Subscription } from './resolvers';
...

const pubsub = new PubSub();

const server = new GraphQLServer({
    typeDefs: './src/schema.graphql',
    resolvers: { Query, Mutation, User, Post, Comment, Subscription },
    context: { db, pubsub },
});

...

Step 3

Create a new file at resolvers/Subscription.js

const Subscription = {
    count: {
        subscribe(parent, args, { pubsub }, info) {
            let count = 0;
            setInterval(() => {
                count++;
                pubsub.publish('count', {
                    count,
                });
            }, 1000);
            // asyncIterator(channelName: string, )
            return pubsub.asyncIterator('count');
        },
    },
};

export { Subscription as default };
